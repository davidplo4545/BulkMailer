# BulkMailer

This is my first C# Application WinForms application in GitHub called: Bulk Mailer.

The bulk mailer is an application that allows you to send emails/messages to 
other people through the SMTP protocol.

Requirments:

- The application currently only works for GMAIL, so your user settings should be
a registered email in GMAIL.

- Please make sure to enable "Access to less secure application" in this link https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps 
so the application will be able to send emails appropriately.

Application UI:

Any recommendations/advices/ questions are welcome!
